Smooth Valley Brewing is a home brewery in Wallisellen, Switzerland, founded
in 2015, with an annual production of about one hectoliter. The brewery's named after a blues club I used to fantasize about opening on those days when everything about research seemed utterly pointless, itself named after a literal translation of the name of the region of Zurich I live in (Glatttal). 

I'm currently running all-grain mash brews using a 20-liter 
[Spiedels Braumeister](https://shop.speidels-braumeister.de/en/20-50-Litre-Braumeister).

This site has information about each batch brewed at Smooth Valley from the
beginning of 2016 on. Some information about 2015 batches can be found on my [blog](https://trammell.ch/2015/12/a-year-in-beer/).
