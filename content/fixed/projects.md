## Next up

I've got the ingredients for another version of _..and time is still marching on_, which probably also gets a name inspired by They Might Be Giants. But I think I'd like to try making it a bit fruitier, so I'll be switching out the hops and the yeast. I'd also like to experiment with mash-extract brewing with the Braumeister for higher gravity beers, since the malt pipe capacity means it's basically designed for initial gravities of not much greater than 15&deg;P. So it probably won't resemble SiOS UrAlt that much at the end of the day.

## Over the horizon

Things I'd like to try in 2017:

- A Belgian wit. Need to see if [SiOS](http://sios.ch) has a recipe for this to start from.
