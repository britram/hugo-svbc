**Brewed** *21 Feb 2016* | **Bottled** *5 Mar 2016* | **Yield** *17.5 L / 6.4% (16.2&deg;P &#x2192; 3.7&deg;P)*

Details coming soon. This was my last partial mash brew. It boiled over -
twice, the second time while I was explaining what a boilover was to some
friends - and the cleaning of the kitchen took twice as long as the actual
brewing.

This was heavy and caramel-sweet after a couple months in the cellar. I forgot
about it and drank a bunch of [Easter Steam](/easter-steam/) and
[Sheepgoat](/sheepgoat-a/) instead. Thought about pitching it down the drain
to get the bottles back. Tried one in August (just in case) and it had matured
very, very nicely. Lesson: leave high final gravity beers to bottle condition
for longer.
