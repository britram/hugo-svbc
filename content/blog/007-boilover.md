Story of the boilovers. Decided to get a bigger brewpot.

## Grain Bill

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added hops as follows:

  - XXg XX.X% name of hops
  - XXg XX.X% name of hops
- Flavor hops at XX min:

- Aroma hops at XX min:

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to XX&deg;C with an immersion cooler took XXX minutes. Initial gravity was XX.X&deg;P. I pitched name of yeast; enthusiastic fermentation started after about XXX hours, and lasted XXX days. Temperature during fermentation remained near XX&deg;C. Final gravity was X.X&deg;P, for X.X% ABV.

## Bottling

I bottled XXL after XXX days in the fermenter, adding XXXg light DME dissolved in XXXmL water to the bottling bucket for priming. 

## How is it, then?

Heavy and caramel-sweet after a couple months in the cellar. Forgot about it, drank a bunch of Easter Steam and Sheepgoat instead. Thought about pitching it down the drain to get the bottles back. Tried one in August (just in case) and it had matured very, very nicely. Lesson: leave high final gravity beers to bottle condition for longer.
