This was a tiny tweak to [Sheepgoat Rev. B](/sheepgoat-b/) for experimental purposes: I modified the mash program to add a short, warm protein rest and a short dextrose rest to the 


## Grain Bill

- 3900g Pale Ale malt (7 EBC)
- 350g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 270g Caram√ºnch 2 (120 EBC)
- 100g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid Malt (5 EBC)

## Mash

I mashed in 23L water at 57&deg;C, and ran the five-rest a simple three-rest mash program:

- 10 min @ 57&deg;C
- 60 min @ 63&deg;C 
- 15 min @ 67&deg;C

I then sparged with 8L water at 78&deg;C. In contrast to previous brews,
sparging only took 25 minutes to complete.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added hops as follows:   

- Bittering: 60 min 27g 13.3% Pacific Jade
- Flavor: 30 min 10g 13.2% Citra 
- Flavor: 30 min 12g 11.9% Chinook
- Aroma: 2 min 20g 13.2% Citra 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 11.9% Chinook 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 13.3% Pacific Jade

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 19&deg;C with an immersion cooler took 26 minutes: colder tap water
in winter made this significantly faster than the last brew. Initial gravity
was 11.7&deg;P. I pitched Wyeast 1332 Northwest Ale; enthusiastic fermentation
started after about 12 hours, and lasted six days. Slow fermentation continued
a further three days. Final gravity was 2.1&deg;P, for 5.1% ABV.

# Kegging

![look, pressure](/img/sheepgoat-kegged.jpg)

I added 95g of light DME to 250mL of water, boiled and cooled, put it in an 18L Cornelius keg, then added 17.75L of beer from the fermenter to the keg. I pressurized to 250 hPa to make sure the seals held. I'm currently holding the keg at 22&deg;C for secondary fermentation, then it'll be off to the cellar for a month or two at around 14&deg;C, weather depending.
