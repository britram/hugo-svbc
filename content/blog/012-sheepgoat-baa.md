frontmatter: Sheepgoat B worked out really well, so more of the same. Tweaked the mash program as an experiment. 

## Grain Bill

- 3900g Pale Ale malt
- 350g Light Wheat malt
- 270g Caram√ºnch 2
- 100g Carapils
- 80g Acid Malt

## Mash

This is the only modification from Rev B. It appears to have increased yield slightly, so will stick with it in the future.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added hops as follows:   

- 60 min 25g 13.3% Pacific Jade
- 30 min 10g 13.2% Citra 
- 30 min 10g 11.9% Chinook
- 2 min 15g 13.2% Citra 
- 2 min 10g 11.9% Chinook 
- 2 min 10g 13.3% Pacific Jade

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 24&deg;C with an immersion cooler took 45 minutes. Initial gravity was 11.3&deg;P. I pitched Wyeast 1332 Northwest Ale; enthusiastic fermentation started after about 36 hours, and lasted five days. Final gravity was 2.0&deg;P, for 4.9% ABV.

## Bottling

I bottled a total yield of 19L after twelve days in the fermenter, adding 120g light DME dissolved in 300mL water to the bottling bucket for priming. 

## How is it, then?

After cellaring for a month at around 17&deg;C, the new Sheepgoat is an extremely drinkable pale ale. The Citra and Chinook flavor and aroma hops lend it a very American IPA character, while the malted wheat rounds out the malt flavor a bit. I was convinced enough by it to run it again with a minor tweak to the mash program.
