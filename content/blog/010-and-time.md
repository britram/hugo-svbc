This is another running-a-recipe brew, this time with [SIOS](https://sios.ch/)
[UrAlt](https://www.sios.ch/SIOS-UrAlt-Mash-Recipe-yields-20-liter).
Characterized as an "original Altbier", it's dark but crisp and refreshing. I
ran this recipe because I wanted something a little darker to drink through
the winter, and it's not disappointing.

The name comes from [They Might Be Giants'](http://www.theymightbegiants.com/)
[Older](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdIRrmNN_CQ), which was running 
through my head while brewing it (probably 'cause it's an 'alt').

## Grain Bill

- 3470g Pilsner Malt
- 380g Münchner Malt
- 280g Light Wheat Malt (4 EBC)
- 140g Caramel Malt (25 EBC)
- 150g Roasted Wheat (1000 EBC)

## Mash

I mashed in 20L water at 46&deg;C, and ran the five-rest mash program called
for by the recipe:

- 10 min @ 46&deg;C
- 10 min @ 53&deg;C 
- 30 min @ 62&deg;C
- 15 min @ 72&deg;C
- 5 min @ 78&deg;C

I sparged with 9L at 78&deg;C, two liters at a time. Mashing out took about  60 minutes.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added
hops as follows, as called for by the recipe:

- Bittering: 60 min 20g 12.5% Magnum
- Flavor: 20 min 30g 2.4% Tettnanger
- Aroma: 5 min 26g 13.2% Saazer

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 24&deg;C with an immersion cooler took 27 minutes. Initial gravity
was 13.2&deg;P. I pitched Wyeast 2565 Kölsch; fermentation started after about
6 hours, and lasted 4 days. Temperature during fermentation remained near
24&deg;C. Final gravity was 3.1&deg;P, for 5.4% ABV.

## Bottling

I moved 17L to the bottling bucket on 2 July, adding 120g light dry malt
extract dissolved in 300mL water for priming. 11.8L of this I put in bottles,
the remaining 6.2 in a corny keg.

## How is it, then?

Dark but crisp. The Kölsch yeast gives it a definite ale character, but it's not too... kölschy. Next up is an experiment with the same grain bill but different hops and yeast.
