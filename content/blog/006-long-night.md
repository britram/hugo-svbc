**Brewed** *16 Jan 2016* | **Bottled** *23 Jan 2016* | **Yield** *19.5 L / 5.5% (13.5&deg;P &#x2192; 2.8&deg;P)*

Details coming soon. This was mainly an experiment in how dark a partial mash-
extract beer can be and still be drinkable, and it worked out pretty well. I
submitted it to the SIOS Trophy 2016, my first competition, which rated it as
thoroughly median (average of 8 ratings was 26.75/36).

A year later, I still had two of these in the bottle. I opened one on 21 Jan
2017, and it's held up nicely.
