I liked [Sheepgoat](/sheepgoat/), but it was (unsurprisingly) a little
caramel-malty (due to the Münchner malt), and the hops also weren't quite what
I was going for. I did want to keep the name though. So in the spirit of
completely uncontrolled experimentation, I dropped the Münchner, added a
little light wheat malt, and switched to a simpler, lower temperature malt
program to make the result more fermentable.

## Grain Bill

- 3900g Pale Ale malt (7 EBC)
- 350g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 270g Caramünch 2 (120 EBC)
- 100g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid Malt (5 EBC)

## Mash

I used an English-style ("absteigend") single-temperature mash program for this brew: 20L of water at 64&deg;C for 75 minutes, sparged with 9L at 78&deg;C, two liters at a time. Mashing out took about 50 minutes.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added hops as follows:   

- Bittering: 60 min 25g 13.3% Pacific Jade
- Flavor: 30 min 10g 13.2% Citra 
- Flavor: 30 min 10g 11.9% Chinook
- Aroma: 2 min 15g 13.2% Citra 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 11.9% Chinook 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 13.3% Pacific Jade

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 24&deg;C with an immersion cooler took 45 minutes. Initial gravity was 11.3&deg;P. I pitched Wyeast 1332 Northwest Ale; enthusiastic fermentation started after about 36 hours, and lasted five days. Final gravity was 2.0&deg;P, for 4.9% ABV.

## Bottling

I bottled a total yield of 19L after twelve days in the fermenter, adding 120g light DME dissolved in 300mL water to the bottling bucket for priming. 

## How is it, then?

After cellaring for a month at around 17&deg;C, the new Sheepgoat is an extremely drinkable pale ale. The Citra and Chinook flavor and aroma hops lend it a very American IPA character, while the malted wheat rounds out the malt flavor a bit. I was convinced enough by it to [run it again](/sheepgoat-baa/) with a minor tweak to the mash program.
