This was a relatively large tweak to  
[...and time is still marching on](/and-time/): 
starting with the same grain bill, adding some dark malt extract I had lying
around from [Long Night](/long-night/) and a dash of honey to up the gravity,
swapping out the yeast and the hops to make it a bit less Alt and to nudge it
in the direction of Long Night.

The name continues the 
[They Might Be Giants](http://www.theymightbegiants.com/) 
time-related song title theme.

## Grain Bill

- 3900g Pale Ale malt (7 EBC)
- 350g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 270g Caram√ºnch 2 (120 EBC)
- 100g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid Malt (5 EBC)

### Adjuncts

- 500g Brewferm Dark DME (57 EBC)
- 300g Acacia Honey

## Mash

[FIXME this isn't the actual mash program]

I mashed in 20L water at 46&deg;C, and ran the five-rest mash program called
for by the recipe:

- 10 min @ 46&deg;C
- 10 min @ 53&deg;C 
- 30 min @ 62&deg;C
- 15 min @ 72&deg;C
- 5 min @ 78&deg;C

I then sparged with 8L water at 78&deg;C. As with the [last brew](/sheepgoat-baa/), mashing out was relatively quick at 25 minutes. I suspect this has something to do with the grain mill at SIOS -- this grain bill was ground at the same time as Sheepgoat's.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added hops as follows:   

[FIXME these aren't the actual hops]

- Bittering: 60 min 27g 13.3% Pacific Jade
- Flavor: 30 min 10g 13.2% Citra 
- Flavor: 30 min 12g 11.9% Chinook
- Aroma: 2 min 20g 13.2% Citra 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 11.9% Chinook 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 13.3% Pacific Jade

I added the DME and honey ten minutes before knockout.

## Pitching and Fermentation

[FIXME fill in the Xs]

Cooling to 23.5&deg;C with an immersion cooler took XX minutes. Initial gravity
was xx.x&deg;P. I pitched Wyeast 1xxx Denny's Favorite; extremely enthusiastic fermentation
started after about 6 hours, and lasted three days. Slow fermentation continued
a further three days. Final gravity was 3.3&deg;P, for 6.1% ABV.

# Kegging

I added 95g of light DME to 300mL of water, boiled and cooled, put it in an
18L Cornelius keg, then added 17.7L of beer from the fermenter to the keg. I
pressurized to 250 hPa to make sure the seals held. As with the last batch,
I'm currently holding the keg at 22&deg;C for secondary fermentation.
