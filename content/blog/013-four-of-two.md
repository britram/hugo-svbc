This was a relatively large tweak to [...and time is still marching on](/and-time/): 
starting with the same grain bill, adding some dark malt extract I had lying
around from [Long Night](/long-night/) and a dash of honey to up the gravity,
swapping out the yeast and the hops to make it a bit less Alt and to nudge it
in the direction of Long Night.

The name continues the 
[They Might Be Giants](http://www.theymightbegiants.com/) 
time-related song title theme.

## Grain Bill

- 3900g Pale Ale malt (7 EBC)
- 350g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 270g Caram√ºnch 2 (120 EBC)
- 100g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid Malt (5 EBC)

### Adjuncts

- 500g Brewferm Dark DME (57 EBC)
- 300g Acacia Honey

## Mash

I mashed in 20L water at 46&deg;C, and ran a three-rest mash program, details coming soon.

I then sparged with 8L water at 78&deg;C. As with the [last brew](/sheepgoat-baa/), mashing out was relatively quick at 25 minutes. I suspect this has something to do with the grain mill at SIOS -- this grain bill was ground at the same time as Sheepgoat's.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added
Chinook, Cascade, and Mandarina Bavaria hops; details coming soon. I added the
DME and honey ten minutes before knockout.

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 23.5&deg;C with an immersion cooler took XX minutes. Initial
gravity was 14.7&deg;P. I pitched a smack pack of Wyeast 1450 
[Denny's Favorite](https://wyeastlab.com/yeast-strain/dennys-favorite-50-ale); 
extremely enthusiastic fermentation started after about 6 hours, and
lasted three days. Slow fermentation continued a further three days. Final
gravity was 3.3&deg;P, for 6.1% ABV.

# Kegging

I added 95g of light DME to 300mL of water, boiled and cooled, put it in an
18L Cornelius keg, then added 17.7L of beer from the fermenter to the keg. I
pressurized to 250 hPa to make sure the seals held. As with the last batch,
I'm currently holding the keg at 22&deg;C for secondary fermentation.
