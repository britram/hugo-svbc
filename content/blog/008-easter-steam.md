**Brewed** *21 Mar 2016* | **Bottled** *27 Mar 2016* | **Yield** *11 L / 5.9% (14.0&deg;P &#x2192; 3.0&deg;P)*

Details coming soon. This was my first Brewmeister brew, and consisted of
running a recipe ([SIOS](https://sios.ch/)  [VollHell](https://www.sios.ch
/Vollhell-Mash-Recipe-yields-20-liter) Bohemian Ale) to try and figure out how
the thing worked. It was clear I had no idea what I was doing: lautering
stalled after a half hour and half, and only twelve liters in. But it was totally drinkable, if a little boring.
