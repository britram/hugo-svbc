**Brewed** *2 Sep 2017* | **Kegged** *9 Sep 2017* | **Yield** *20.5 L / 4.6% (10.7&deg;P &#x2192; 2.0&deg;P)*- - -

This is an attempt to get something that kind of tastes like a Belgian wit
without having to go to all the trouble of dealing with unmalted wheat. So, half
barley, half wheat, all malted: half wit.

The name is a reference to Zaventem, a village at the edge of the historical
range of Witbier brewing in Flanders, which is now home to Brussels Airport,
where I spend a fair amount of time.

## Grain Bill

- 2270g Pilsner malt (7 EBC)
- 2270g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 80g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid malt (5 EBC)

## Adjuncts

- 25g organic orange peel 
- 25g whole coriander seeds

## Mash

For the first time, I started with whole grains, and crushed them in a stone
flour mill set to  a coarseness beyond its design. I could claim this was in the
spirit of experimentation, but it was really more in the spirit of forgetting to
click the "please crush my grainbill" box on the website when I ordered it.

I'll need to tweak the setting a bit next time, because while most of the grains
shattered nicely, I did notice quite a few intact grains with cracked hulls on
mashing out. I suspect this contributed to the slightly lower gravity extraction
compared to Sheepgoat.

After a bit of research (mainly on homebrew sites written in Dutch, which it
turns out are basically intelligible if you speak homebrewer in English and
German) I decided to go with a longer mash program, as follows:

- Mash in 23L @ 54&deg;C
- 30 min @ 62&deg;C 
- 40 min @ 65&deg;C 
- 10 min @ 72&deg;C
- 5 min @ 75&deg;C
- 5 min @ 78&deg;C

Mashing out took a relatively short 15 minutes, with 7.7L of water, for a boil
volume of 26L.

## Boil

I boiled the wort for five minutes before adding the first hops, then added hops
and spices as follows:   

- Bittering: 60 min 25g 5.7% Mandarina Bavaria
- Flavor: 30 min 12g 5.7% Mandarina Bavaria
- Flavor: 30 min 25g whole coriander seeds
- Aroma: 3 min 8g 5.7% Mandarina Bavaria
- Aroma: 3 min 25g chopped organic orange peel

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 24&deg;C with an immersion cooler took about 45 minutes; my usual
trick of using the Braumeister's pump to circulate the wort doesn't work very
well with orange peel in the mix. Initial gravity was 10.7&deg;P. I pitched
Wyeast 3944 Belgian Wit to 23L of wort. Enthusiastic fermentation started after
about 6 hours, and continued for three days. 

# Kegging

Final yield was 20.5L, primed with 107g table sugar in 500mL of water, kegged
7.75L and bottled the remainder.

# How is it, then?

Conditioning in the cellar until mid-October, but the green beer tastes like I
might have done this one right.
