**Brewed** *not yet* | **Kegged** *not yet* | **Yield** *not yet*
- - -

This is an attempt to get something that kind of tastes like a Belgian wit without having to go to all the trouble of dealing with unpalted wheat

![mmm hops](/img/sheepgoat-baa-brewing.jpg)

This was a tiny tweak to [Sheepgoat Rev. B](/sheepgoat-b/) for experimental
purposes: I modified the mash program to add a short, warm protein rest and a
short dextrose rest. Efficiency was a bit better... but still not great.

## Grain Bill

- 2270g Pilsner malt (7 EBC)
- 2270g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 80g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid Malt (5 EBC)

## Adjuncts

- Organic orange peel (enough)
- Coriander (enough)

## Mash

Plan to run the same simple program as Sheepgoat:

- 10 min @ 57&deg;C
- 60 min @ 63&deg;C 
- 15 min @ 67&deg;C

## Boil

Hopping should be  

- Bittering: 60 min 27g 13.3% Pacific Jade
- Flavor: 30 min 10g 13.2% Citra 
- Flavor: 30 min 12g 11.9% Chinook
- Aroma: 2 min 20g 13.2% Citra 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 11.9% Chinook 
- Aroma: 2 min 10g 13.3% Pacific Jade

## Pitching and Fermentation

Cooling to 19&deg;C with an immersion cooler took 26 minutes: colder tap water
in winter made this significantly faster than the last brew. Initial gravity
was 11.7&deg;P. I pitched Wyeast 1332 Northwest Ale; enthusiastic fermentation
started after about 12 hours, and lasted six days. Slow fermentation continued
a further three days. Final gravity was 2.1&deg;P, for 5.1% ABV.

# Kegging

![look, pressure](/img/sheepgoat-kegged.jpg)

I added 95g of light DME to 250mL of water, boiled and cooled, put it in an
18L Cornelius keg, then added 17.75L of beer from the fermenter to the keg. I
pressurized to 250 hPa to make sure the seals held. I'm currently holding the
keg at 22&deg;C for secondary fermentation, and moved it down to the cellar
after two weeks for a month or two at around 15&deg;C.

# How is it, then?

The tweak to the mash program added a barely perceptible body to the beer. This
is a solid, not-too-hoppy pale ale, and the one I'll keep brewing as my "I want
a beer" beer.
