This is an attempt to get something that kind of tastes like a Belgian wit without having to go to all the trouble of dealing with unpalted wheat

![mmm hops](/img/sheepgoat-baa-brewing.jpg)

This was a tiny tweak to [Sheepgoat Rev. B](/sheepgoat-b/) for experimental
purposes: I modified the mash program to add a short, warm protein rest and a
short dextrose rest. Efficiency was a bit better... but still not great.

## Grain Bill

- 2270g Pilsner malt (7 EBC)
- 2270g Light Wheat malt (4 EBC)
- 80g Carapils (5 EBC)
- 80g Acid Malt (5 EBC)

## Adjuncts

- Organic orange peel (enough)
- Coriander (enough)

## Mash

Plan to run the same simple program as Sheepgoat:

- 10 min @ 57&deg;C
- 60 min @ 63&deg;C 
- 15 min @ 67&deg;C

## Boil

Hopping should be lighter and in character; still have some Mandarina Bavaria so let's try that. 25g bittering, 25g flavor, no aroma.

## Pitching and Fermentation

Plan to cool to 20&deg;C with an immersion cooler, pitch a suitable Belgian yeast.

# Kegging

I'm out of light DME, so plan to prime with table sugar.
